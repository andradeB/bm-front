Box

The most abstract styling component in Chakra UI on top of which all other Chakra UI components are built.

The `Box` component provides an easy way to write styles with ease. It provides access to design tokens and an unmatched DX when writing responsive styles.

```
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react"

<Box />
```

### [Shorthand](#shorthand)

Use shorthand like `bg` instead of `backgroundColor`, `m` instead of `margin`, etc.

### [Pseudo Props](#pseudo-props)

Use pseudo props like `_hover` to apply styles on hover, `_focus` to apply styles on focus, etc.

### [Border](#border)

Use the `borderWidth` and `borderColor` prop to apply border styles.

**Good to know:** Chakra applies `borderStyle: solid` globally so you don't have to.

Use the `as` prop to render a different component.

Inspect the DOM to see the rendered component.

Use the `boxShadow` or `shadow` prop to apply shadow styles.
